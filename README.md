# About:
This was simply a mini passion project for me wanting to create a unique theme for my 280V, that was genuinely "simple" to navigate. That being said, I tried to make it a point to include all of the main button prompts in this theme. Unfortunately though, I will have to mention I do not own any other devices besides a Anbernic 280V, so I'm not 100% certain yet that you won't have issues. I've compiled a 640x480 version though for those with that resolution along with the upscaled textures. If things end up looking misaligned at all you should be able to fix it with some tinkering within the theme.ini file. 

Anyway, I would like to say I hope everyone enjoys this theme as much as I've enjoyed creating it. I worked pretty hard on it. Theming like this is definitely not something I've normally done before either, so it took me some time to learn and come up with an idea before I could make progress on it. That being said I definitely could have gone A LOT further with this such as including more new dialogue per system, but honestly the project would've taken so much longer. I don't want to spend anymore time on this when I've already moved onto other devices. Maybe you have as well, but regardless it's at least here now for those who want it.
