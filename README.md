# About:
This was simply a mini passion project for me wanting to create a unique theme for my 280V that was genuinely "simple" to navigate. Unfortunately though, I will have to mention I do not own any other devices that use SimpleMenu, so I'm not 100% certain yet that you won't have issues with this. I've compiled a 640x480 version though for those with that resolution along with the upscaled textures. If it isn't looking right for your device, it should in theory work with some tinkering in the theme.ini file.
