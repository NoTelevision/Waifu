# About:
This was simply a mini passion project for me wanting to create a unique theme for my 280V, that was genuinely "simple" to navigate. That being said, I tried to make it a point to include all of the main button prompts in this theme. Unfortunately though, I will have to mention I do not own any other devices that use SimpleMenu, so I'm not 100% certain yet that you won't have any issues. I've compiled a 640x480 version though for those with that resolution along with the upscaled textures. If things end up looking misaligned at all in this version, rest assured it should be fixable with some tinkering within the theme.ini file. 

Anyway, I would like to say I hope everyone enjoys this theme as much as I've enjoyed creating it. I worked pretty hard to create this theme. This is definitely not something I normally do so it took me some time to come up with an idea, create all of the shapes, resize everything, and modify Rin to blend in with the background I chose. It was fun but yeah not something I'm super experienced in. Other than that, I'll say I definitely could have gone A LOT further with this such as including more new dialogue, but honestly the project would've taken so much longer to finish. I'm really not sure that would be worth all that extra effort. Nonetheless I'm happy with it. :)
